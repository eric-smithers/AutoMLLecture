\begin{frame}[c]{Motivation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If we define AutoML as an optimization process, the incumbent solution\\ (i.e., the best found configuration so far) gradually improves over time
		\medskip
		\pause
		\item We don't know when users will stop the AutoML process
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Running over the coffee break (15min)
			\item Running during a meeting (1h)
			\item Running over night (16h)
			\item Running over the weekend (48+h)
		\end{itemize}
		\pause
		\medskip
		\item[$\leadsto$] Anytime performance of AutoML is important
		\begin{itemize}
			\item i.e., the AutoML tool should return the best possible solution at each time point
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[c]{Summary}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Plotting anytime performance is helpful
		\medskip
		\item On real benchmarks often better to plot CPU time instead of function evaluations
		\medskip
		\item Use step functions!
		\medskip
		\item Consider log-scales on x and/or y
		\medskip
		\item Consider different ways for plotting the uncertainty of cost observations 
	\end{enumerate}
